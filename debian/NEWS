network-manager-openconnect (0.9.8.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

    The network-manager-openconnect-gnome package is no longer installed
    automatically by network-manager-openconnect.  As announced earlier, it
    had been listed as a recommended dependency for one release cycle to
    ensure smooth upgrades.  GNOME users should now explicitly install the
    network-manager-openconnect-gnome package for GNOME desktop integration.

network-manager-openconnect (0.9.4.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

    This package has been split into network-manager-openconnect and
    network-manager-openconnect-gnome to separate the core functionality from
    the GNOME GUI components.  For now, network-manager-openconnect-gnome is a
    recommendation so that current users will not lose capability.  GNOME
    desktop users should explicitly install network-manager-openconnect-gnome
    from now on as this recommendation will be dropped in a future version.
